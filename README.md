# Career Scraper
This project is a program that will scrape posts off the CS Career Questions subreddit. It is made in Python and uses the Python Reddit API Wrapper (PRAW).

This project will be the first in a set of several. It will scrape data from Reddit with several options including: top posts, newest, and keywords. 

In the future, this project will be used for sentiment analysis of various terms throughout specific subreddits.
